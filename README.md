# Personal Documentation
Static website built with Hextra Starter Template [theme](https://github.com/imfing/hextra-starter-template). 

This website is a personal software documentation that I can access to from anywhere (by hosting it for free with Github Pages).

Right now, there is a documentation about :
- Docker
- Wordpress
- Apache (not a lot yet)
