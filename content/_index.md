Personal documentation available for everyone (including myself). Helps me at work when I need to do a configuration setup I have done in the past. This website allows me to access this from device with a browser. Pretty convenient !

Writing this documentation helps me understand all these different technologies that are essential for administering computers and deploying infrastructures.
